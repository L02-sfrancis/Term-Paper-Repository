## Step 1: Conducting the BLAST Search
To find potential homologs of the gene XP_021351142.1, a BLAST search was conducted (Altschul et al., 1997). A maximum e-value of 1e-35 was set to recover homologs with high sequence identities and alignments scores. Afterwards the top hit  was used to decipher the gene family of focus.
